# Discovery queries
These queries have been used to identify targets that match certain use cases and examples we want to showcase
as part of this PoC. The file name indicates the objective of the query and what is should return.

Please note that, due the amount of data being scanned for these targets, some of these queries take several minutes
to complete, and sometimes half an hour. This is sometimes due to the fact that we tried to include data that would inform
the selection of a target for a use case: the type of target (person vs entity), the risks against a UBO relative, etc.

The CSVs contain the complete output of a query run, and they can be used to pick and test targets that match a desired use case.
The larger CSVs have been compressed to make them manageable in a Git repo.
